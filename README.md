# Meat-Home (Back-End)

This is the first full stack project i have build all by myself. This is a small website to my brother's small business. In this website a costumer can make a reservation and the admin can look at the reservations, edit them, sort them and more.  The main technologies i used to build this website are: Node.js, Express, React and Mapbox.
